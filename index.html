  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
The history of mathematics is a diverse search for understanding across civilizations. From the revolutionising trigonometry discoveries by the Arabs to the transformative innovations in classical Greece, the mathematical links continents, showcasing a vibrant chain of ideas. Pivotal milestones, like India's concept of zero and the Islamic Golden Age's advancements in algebra and trigonometry, added rich layers to this historical narrative. The Renaissance in Europe ignited a resurgence of mathematical exploration, led by visionaries such as Leonardo da Vinci, Copernicus, and Kepler, profoundly impacting astronomy and scientific thought.

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p>
The history of mathematics is a captivating journey that transcends time and borders, reflecting the remarkable cleverness of human thought and its pervasive impact on the development of societies worldwide. From the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt, where rudimentary arithmetic and geometric principles were first cultivated(A History of Mathematics by carl B.Boyer 1994), to the innovative contributions of classical Greece, the mathematical lineage extends across continents, revealing a fascinating interplay of ideas and influences.  
  </p>
  <p>
    The emergence of revolutionary concepts like zero and the numeral system in India, the profound advancements in China, and the preservation and expansion of knowledge during the Islamic Golden Age all added vibrant contributions to the rich tapestry of mathematical history. As we traverse through the Renaissance in Europe and delve into the modern era, we witness the global exchange of mathematical ideas and their transformative effect on our understanding of the world.

  <h3 id="Analysis and Discussion">Analysis and Discussion</h3>
  <p>
During the Islamic Golden Age (8th to 14th centuries), Arab mathematicians made large contributions to the field of algebra, fundamentally transforming mathematical thinking. The world of mathematics by james R.Newman (1956) states that influenced by Indian and Greek mathematical concepts, scholars such as Al-Khwarizmi, often referred to as the "father of algebra," wrote foundational texts like "Kitab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala" (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing). 
  </p>
  <p>
This book introduced systematic methods for solving linear and quadratic equations and laid the groundwork for algebraic manipulation, including the use of variables and coefficients, marking a pivotal shift from arithmetic to abstract mathematical reasoning. In addition to their advancements in algebra, Arab mathematicians made significant strides in trigonometry.   </p>
  <p>
Mathematics across cultures: The History of Non-Western mathematics by Helaine selin (2000) states scholars like Al-Battani (Albategnius) refined and expanded upon Greek trigonometry, developing new methods for calculating sine and tangent functions, producing more accurate astronomical tables, and making substantial contributions to the understanding of spherical trigonometry. The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam: A Sourcebook by Victor J. Katz (2007) stated that their work not only improved astronomical predictions but also provided practical solutions for navigation and land surveying. Arab mathematicians' observations and calculations in trigonometry served as a steppingstone for later developments in mathematics and astronomy, profoundly influencing the scientific knowledge of subsequent generations.
  </p>
  <p>
Mathematics and Its History by John Stillwell (1989) stated that ancient Greek mathematicians, notably Euclid, Pythagoras, and Archimedes, unveiled geometric revelations that became foundational pillars in mathematics. Euclid's magnum opus, "Elements," outlined a system of geometry, providing a new approach to proofs and propositions that influenced mathematical thinking for centuries. Pythagoras's theorem, fundamental in understanding the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle, showcased the interplay between geometric shapes and numerical relationships. Archimedes, with his innovations in geometry and calculus, explored areas, volumes, and centres of gravity, revolutionizing mathematical concepts and becoming the start of future developments. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The Greeks' geometric revelations also laid the groundwork for abstract thinking and mathematical reasoning that transcended their era, impacting diverse fields of science and mathematics for thousands of years to come.  
  </p>
  <p>
    The European Renaissance marked a pivotal period in the advancement of mathematics, started by a resurgence of intellectual curiosity and a revival of classical learning.   
  </p>
  <p>
    “Men of Mathematics" by E.T. Bell (1937) spoke on Visionaries like Leonardo da Vinci, Nicolaus Copernicus, and Johannes Kepler made significant contributions to various mathematical fields. Leonardo da Vinci, recognised for his artistic mastery, delved into mathematics, exploring concepts of geometry, proportion, and the mathematical laws governing nature's designs. Copernicus's model of the solar system transformed astronomical thought, relying on mathematical calculations to challenge the geocentric view. Kepler, building upon Copernicus's work, formulated his laws of planetary motion, using mathematical principles to describe the orbits of celestial bodies.  
  </p>
  <p>
The Swerve: How the World Became Modern" by Stephen Greenblatt (2011) taught that the invention of the printing press enabled the spread of mathematical ideas, fostering collaboration among scholars and facilitating the spread of mathematical knowledge. The European Renaissance created an environment that led to further mathematical inquiry, laying the groundwork for the scientific revolution and.       paving the way for future mathematical innovations that would shape the modern world.
